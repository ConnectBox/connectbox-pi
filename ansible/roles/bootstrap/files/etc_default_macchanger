# before bringing up any network interface, run macchanger. Careful, this is
# not guaranteed to prevent leaking your real MAC address before the new one
# gets assigned!

ENABLE_ON_POST_UP_DOWN=true


# by default, macchanger runs on all network interfaces but loopback (lo).  If
# you only want it to run on specific network interfaces, set them here:

ENABLE_INTERFACES="wlan0"
ENABLE_INTERFACES="wlan1"

# This file has five functions:
# 1) to completely disable starting dnsmasq,
# 2) to set DOMAIN_SUFFIX by running `dnsdomainname`
# 3) to select an alternative config file
#    by setting DNSMASQ_OPTS to --conf-file=<file>
# 4) to tell dnsmasq to read the files in /etc/dnsmasq.d for
#    more configuration variables.
# 5) to stop the resolvconf package from controlling dnsmasq's
#    idea of which upstream nameservers to use.
#
# Whether or not to run the dnsmasq daemon; set to 0 to disable.

# By default search this drop directory for configuration options.
# Libvirt leaves a file here to make the system dnsmasq play nice.
# Comment out this line if you don't want this. The dpkg-* are file
# endings which cause dnsmasq to skip that file. This avoids pulling
# in backups made by dpkg.

    msg: |
      Once this playbook run has finished, do not reboot the device.
      If the device is rebooted, the resizing of the root filesystem
      would not happen for users of the image, and their wifi regulatory
      domain may be set incorrectly.

# Skip lint because there's no way that ansible-lint can know at build time
#  that we're legitimately use shell because of the && that is always
#  present when this is run.

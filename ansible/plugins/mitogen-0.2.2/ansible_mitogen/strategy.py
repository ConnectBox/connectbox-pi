    This mix-in enhances any built-in strategy by arranging for various Mitogen
    services to be initialized in the Ansible top-level process, and for worker
    processes to grow support for using those top-level services to communicate
    with and execute modules on remote hosts.

    Mitogen:

        A private Broker IO multiplexer thread is created to dispatch IO
        between the local Router and any connected streams, including streams
        connected to Ansible WorkerProcesses, and SSH commands implementing
        connections to remote machines.

        A Router is created that implements message dispatch to any locally
        registered handlers, and message routing for remote streams. Router is
        the junction point through which WorkerProceses and remote SSH contexts
        can communicate.

        Router additionally adds message handlers for a variety of base
        services, review the Standard Handles section of the How It Works guide
        in the documentation.

        A ContextService is installed as a message handler in the master
        process and run on a private thread. It is responsible for accepting
        requests to establish new SSH connections from worker processes, and
        ensuring precisely one connection exists and is reused for subsequent
        playbook steps. The service presently runs in a single thread, so to
        begin with, new SSH connections are serialized.

        Finally a mitogen.unix listener is created through which WorkerProcess
        can establish a connection back into the master process, in order to
        avail of ContextService. A UNIX listener socket is necessary as there
        is no more sane mechanism to arrange for IPC between the Router in the
        master process, and the corresponding Router in the worker process.

    Ansible:

        PluginLoader monkey patches are installed to catch attempts to create
        connection and action plug-ins.

        For connection plug-ins, if the desired method is "local" or "ssh", it
        is redirected to the "mitogen" connection plug-in. That plug-in
        implements communication via a UNIX socket connection to the top-level
        Ansible process, and uses ContextService running in the top-level
        process to actually establish and manage the connection.

        For action plug-ins, the original class is looked up as usual, but a
        new subclass is created dynamically in order to mix-in
        ansible_mitogen.target.ActionModuleMixin, which overrides many of the
        methods usually inherited from ActionBase in order to replace them with
        pure-Python equivalents that avoid the use of shell.

        In particular, _execute_module() is overridden with an implementation
        that uses ansible_mitogen.target.run_module() executed in the target
        Context. run_module() implements module execution by importing the
        module as if it were a normal Python module, and capturing its output
        in the remote process. Since the Mitogen module loader is active in the
        remote process, all the heavy lifting of transferring the action module
        and its dependencies are automatically handled by Mitogen.
